# Backrooms
A friend's discord status 'Exploring the backrooms' got me interested in the subject, so I started researching the topic, and on a video explaining the first 12 levels I saw a comment by William Howell saying "Just imagine a back rooms game where the first person to reach baseline reality wins like Â£50000 and there are like 10,000 levels, and make it a huge single server multiplayer"
